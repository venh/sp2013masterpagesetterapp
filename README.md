In Publishing sites, there will be a layouts or application page through which we can set a custom 
or another master page as a default master page. Unfortunately, this is missing in Team Sites. This is what this solution is all about. It is targeted mainly for Team sites, since publishing sites already have a provision. It adds a custom ribbon button in the Share and Track group of the Files group of Master Page Gallery. This is a SharePoint 2013 Hosted App. Refer the documentation for the technical details. The following screen shots depict the functionality.

Note: I have moved this from my actual project hosted (now archived) in CodePlex at:
